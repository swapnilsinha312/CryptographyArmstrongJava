# CryptographyArmstrongJava
An encryption program using Armstrong numbers and colors in Java


The encryption is a two step process, first is using armstrong digits and the second is using colors

The processing is done on bytes with a preset buffer

The research paper added will explain the entire process in detail

The concept of file handling, multithreading, byte functions and a few others are at use here
